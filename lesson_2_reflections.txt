Q:	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repo with git init, the .git directory is created and
	git is starting to save metadata about that directory - this is what makes
	it a repository, instead of a simple directory. :)

	When running git init, no commit is made. Just a simple, empty repo.

	I need to run git init in order to be able to make commits and enjoy all the
	features of GIT. :)




Q:	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different from by working directory by the fact that it
	stores only the files that are to be committed, instead of all the files
	that we are working on.
	The staging area is different by the repository in the sense that the files
	in it are not yet committed.

	The value it offers is based on the fact that you can choose which files to
	commit and whitch not to - it offers flexibility and freedom of choice. :)
