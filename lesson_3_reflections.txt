Q:	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because if Git would automatically pull, then it could do it in the middle
	of my work, and i would just lose the sight of what i was doing :)).



Q:	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

	Branches operate on commits and are made to separate commits one from
	another (for example if they have different purposes).

	Clones operate on repositories and are made to copy (clone) a repository
	that is found online or on another machine.

	Forks operate on repositories and are made to copy (clone) a repository that
	is found online (on github) into a new repository on the profile of the user
	that forks.



Q:	What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	It lets you know if the current state of the Github repo is ahead of (not in
	sync with) the current state of the local copy of the remote, os it's a very
	good way to know when a sync is needed.

	It also gives a way to combine changes made by the members of the team. If
	one updates the remote and the other updates the local, they can combine
	changes using the local copy of the remote. Fetching, then merging, and
	maybe then pushing the new, combined version.
